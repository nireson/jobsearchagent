        "text": "## Primary Task\nYour task is to search the web for and collect nationwide (do not focus on the LA or Long Beach areas) U.S. job listings that meet the following criteria:\n- Salary range includes $100,000+ per year or $50+ per hour but may start lower and go higher\n- Industry focus: Journalism, Communications, Writing, Editing, or similar roles\n- Exclude technical writing jobs\n- Posted within the last 20 days\n\n\n## Additional Considerations\n-Remote jobs are best\n-Hybrid jobs are next best\n-On-site jobs are worst \n-Look for jobs all across the country, not just in one area\n-Freelance jobs are best\n-Contract jobs are second best\n-Part-time jobs are third best\n-Full-time jobs are fourth best\n\n## Search Strategy\n1. Visit major job boards such as Indeed, LinkedIn Jobs, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, and MediaBistro, but also use other web sources, including Google Jobs\n2. Use search terms combining salary requirements with job categories (e.g., \"journalism $100,000\" OR \"editor $50 hour\")\n3. Filter results by date (last 10 days)\n4. Prioritize listings with explicit salary information\n\n## Data Extraction\nFor each qualifying job, extract and document:\n1. Job title and location classification (Remote, In-office, Hybrid)\n2. Exact salary range as stated in the listing\n3. Verbatim job description text (maintaining original formatting where possible)\n4. Key requirements and responsibilities\n5. Direct application URL (ensuring it's the actual application link, not just the job listing page)\n\n## Error Handling & Resilience\nIf you encounter any of these obstacles:\n- CAPTCHA challenges: Try an alternative job board or search approach\n- Human verification screens: Switch to a different site or search method\n- Popup overlays/chat windows: Attempt to dismiss, or navigate around them\n- Site errors/timeouts: Retry once, then move to an alternative site\n- Login walls: Search for publicly accessible versions of the listing on other platforms\n- Don't try to solve these puzzles on your own\n\nIf a specific job board becomes inaccessible, immediately pivot to others on the list.\n\n## Session Management\n- Track which sites and searches you've already performed to avoid duplication\n- After collecting 10 qualifying jobs, summarize your findings\n- If the search yields fewer than 3 results after 15 steps, expand the date range to 25 days and try for 15 more steps\n- If you can't find the desired number of results after 30 total steps, return what you've found so far as the partial result\n\n## Final Delivery\n1. Present all findings in the specified format\n\n\nBegin your search now and report back with matching jobs as specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Results Format\nPresent each job using this exact format:\n\n```\n**[Job Title]** - [Location]:\n- Salary range: [exact figures as listed]\n- Job type: [Remote/In-office/Hybrid]\n- Job description: [verbatim text from listing]\n- Key requirements/responsibilities: [bulleted list of main qualifications]\n- Application link: [clickable URL]\n```"
